          I am not a burger person but I loved the burgers at Rodeo Goat! Soft bun, juicy meat, and huge on flavor!

The recommended to only have one order of cheese fries with surprise for the table of six. We could have eaten two or even three. The fries were so good. They have a nice size outdoor area, a cool inside area, and there was a cute cat just walking around.

The chocolate mint shake was too chocolate tasting for me. I don't like chocolate very much and was hope for more mint and less chocolate (like a shamrock shake.)

There are so many other great things to do around the area. - Mimi W.

          Went here with a group of friends after visiting some of the breweries nearby and this hit the spot! Everyone loved their burgers. The only complaints we had is they forgot parts of our order so we never got our fries and that the service was really slow. Honestly the burgers are good size so we filled up quickly but we waited really long times to get drinks and food. We also got our food at different times so some people were finishing up as others finally had something arrive. - Karen B.

          I was leaving a birthday party at Chapman& west Restaurant lounge Which is next door to the rodeo goat.  I wanted some bread and a good meal to help after a party. I walked past it and entered a cool open space and seemed it like a poppin area before COVID.

There's a huge window you can walk up to for ordering  to go or you can walk inside and sit at a bar stool at long picnic tables separated  by dividers 6' apart.

My server was nice and suggested his favourite  Burger I got the ranch goat and loved all the ingredients. It was really good. I Ordered a beer as well but don't remember what it was and I forgot to take a picture!

I had a Caesar salad which was really tasty I think there were onion rings that were meant to be croutons and the fries weren't bad as well. All I can say is that I didn't know I was getting charged extra for the bun but all in all the meal itself was good - Daren Thomas

          Tl;dr I still think about these burgers. Skip the fries though.

Wow, Rodeo Goat is like, THE place in Houston to get burgers. Rodeo Goat is like Ben & Jerry's ice cream because they have so many burger toppings expertly paired together for flavor explosions!

My friend and I ordered the Terlingua and Bad Hombre (battle of the burgers). Notably, the Terlingua is topped with chili and corn chips making for an excellent chili burger you never knew you needed.

The Bad Hombre though, was my favorite-- topped with maple bacon, two cheeses, mango pico, cream cheese spread, and hot sauce. It's honestly impressive that Rodeo Goat is able to pile on that many things onto one patty... to say the least, this was a messy burger to eat haha. But Bad Hombre was the perfect combination of textures AND flavors to go with this beefy patty-- spicy, creamy, sweet, savory, what more could you ask for?

The only disappointment of the afternoon was the fries. Our combo order of sweet and regular fries was disappointingly soggy and limp. These were a pass.

Our hostess was kind and attentive, and at the time of visit, tables were appropriately socially distanced.

Looking forward to my next Rodeo Goat burger..!!! - CaronlineSweet334

          Do not go to this place if you're looking for a horrible burger!!!!  

I was attending a conference, staying at the Hilton and decided to venture out to find something better than convention food...  A short walk later and BOOM!  Expecting something average, and then watching them grill other peoples burgers from the bar, I started to get excited for what I was about to enjoy.  I ordered the Bodacious and Chips and Queso and waited patiently enjoying a COLD beer at the bar from the friendly bartender.  The queso arrived first, and it was so good I had to finish the entire bowl.  I would have licked the bowl, but I felt like it was inappropriate.  

The burger arrived and OMFG...  The bun was PERFECT and had a delicious buttered crunch on the rim, the burger was exactly medium like I ordered, every bite was another bite of flavor and enjoyment.  

I explained this to my wife when I got back and we're planning a trip to Houston just for the burger.  That's right, we're gonna fly across the country just for a hamburger, because it was that good. - Sander1223

          I am so glad i could convince my mom to try something new since she is the ultimate hamburger queen  
This place has all social distancing measures along with patio seating since the Covid rates are soaring in houston!
East Downtown location so plenty of restaurants,  parking, sidewalks, and diverse mix of ppl with great skyline  views.
Huge selection of burgers  
Quality meat and options especially since i don't eat red meat! Full Bar and games to distract so what's not to love about this local gem! - Brian R.
